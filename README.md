# EnjoymentOfCode

This is my own implementation according to some of Daniel Shiffman's coding challenge and nature of code.
I've selected some of my code that I think it's interesting. I will also gonna write what each of them can do in their own folder.
Most of them are implemented by using Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) way. That is want I want to learn in the first place, and now I kinda get used to it thanks to Daniel Shiffman's great resource :)

PS. Some of them still have bugs or better way to implement it.
